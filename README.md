## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 

When added a 50% loss one terminal would only copy half the inputs of the other. In my case I counted until 10 4 times and from the 40 numbers, it only copied 18 numbers and they were all random


Answer for Question 2:

It was accurate, it sended all numbers


Answer for Question 3:

It is now slower and it sometimes it gets stuck on a number and then until it is able to print it and the others that came after it, it takes a while.
This happens, because TCP prints it each submission one by one and if it is not able to receive one, it stays there until it can.
